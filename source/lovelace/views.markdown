To display cards on the UI you have to define them in views. Views sort cards in columns based on their `card size`. If you want to group some cards you have to use `stack` cards.

  Use titles and icons to describe the content of views.

## {% linkable_title IDs %}

You can link to one view from another view by its ID. For this use cards that support navigation (`navigation_path`). Do not use special characters in IDs.

### {% linkable_title Example %}

View config:

```yaml
- title: Living room
  # the final path is /lovelace/living_room
  id: living_room
```

Picture card config:

```yaml
- type: picture
  image: /local/living_room.png
  navigation_path: /lovelace/living_room
```

## {% linkable_title Icons %}

If you define an icon the title will be used as a tooltip.

### {% linkable_title Example %}

```yaml
- title: Garden
  icon: mdi:flower
```

## {% linkable_title Panel mode %}

This renders the first card on full width, other cards in this view will not be rendered. Good for cards like `map`, `stack` or `picture-elements`.

### {% linkable_title Example %}

```yaml
- title: Map
  panel: true
  cards:
    - type: map
      entities:
        - device_tracker.demo_paulus
        - zone.home
```

## {% linkable_title Background %}

Style the background of views using [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). For wallpapers you probably want to use the example below, more options can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background).

### {% linkable_title Example %}

```yaml
- title: Living room
  background: center / cover no-repeat url("/local/background.png") fixed
```

## {% linkable_title Themes %}

Set a separate [theme](/components/frontend/#themes) for the view and its cards.

### {% linkable_title Example %}

```yaml
- title: Home
  theme: happy
```
