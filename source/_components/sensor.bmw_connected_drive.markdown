The `bmw_connected_drive` sensor platform allows you to import data on your BMW into Home Assistant.

The sensors will be automatically configured if the `bmw_connected_drive` component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [`bmw_connected_drive` component](/components/bmw_connected_drive/) documentation.
