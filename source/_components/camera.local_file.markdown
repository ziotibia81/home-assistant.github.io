The `local_file` camera platform allows you to integrate an image file from disk into Home Assistant as a camera. If the image is updated on the file system the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. The service `local_file_update_file_path` can be used to update the image using an automation.

The `local_file` camera can for example be used with various camera platforms that save a temporary images locally. It can also be used to display a graph that you render periodically and will then be displayed in Home Assistant.

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: local_file
    file_path: /tmp/image.jpg
```

Configuration variables:

 - **file_path** (*Required*): File to serve as the camera.
 - **name** (*Optional*): Name of the camera
