Geo Location aware entities are typically related to events in the real world in the vicinity of Home Assistant's location, like for example weather events, bush fires or earthquakes.

Entities can have associated geo location coordinates (latitude and longitude) so that they are displayed on the map. The distance from the entity's coordinates to Home Assistant's location can be used for filtering.
