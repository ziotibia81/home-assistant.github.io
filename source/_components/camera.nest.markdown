The `nest` platform allows you to watch still frames from a video stream (not live stream) of your [Nest](https://nest.com/camera/meet-nest-cam/) camera in Home Assistant.

<p class='note'>
You must have the [Nest component](/components/nest/) configured to use this camera.  The `nest` camera will automatically be setup when you do.
</p>

Nest Camera supports `camera.turn_on` and `camera.turn_off` service since 0.75 release.
