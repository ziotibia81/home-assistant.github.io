The `mochad` component is the main component to integrate all X10 platforms being controlled by [mochad](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mochad/). Besides this component you will have to setup your X10 devices separately.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To integrate your Mochad units with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mochad:
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: false
  type: string
  default: localhost
port:
  description: The port that mochad is running on.
  required: false
  type: int
  default: 1099
{% endconfiguration %}
