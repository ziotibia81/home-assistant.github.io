The `android_ip_webcam` component turns an Android phone into a network camera with multiple viewing options.

It's setup as an MJPEG camera and all settings as switches inside of Home Assistant. You can also expose the sensors. If you have multiple phones, you can use all options inside a list.

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

Download [the IP Webcam app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) and launch the app. You will be able to the IP address of the device.
