axis:
  m1065lw:
    host: IP ADDRESS
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
    include:
      - camera
      - motion

  It is recommended that you create a user on your Axis device specifically for Home Assistant. For all current functionality, it is enough to create a user belonging to user group viewer.
