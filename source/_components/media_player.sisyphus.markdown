The [Sisyphus](https://sisyphus-industries.com/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control your Sisyphus Kinetic Art Table.

Media players will be automatically added for each of your Sisyphus tables if the Sisyphus component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [Sisyphus component](/components/sisyphus/) documentation.
