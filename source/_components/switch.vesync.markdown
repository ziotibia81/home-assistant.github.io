The `vesync` switch platform enables integration with Etekcity VeSync smart switches.

VeSync switches are low-cost wifi smart plugs that offer energy monitoring and work with popular voice assistants.

To use your VeSync switches, you must first register your switches with the VeSync app. Once registration is complete you must add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
