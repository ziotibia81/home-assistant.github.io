The `dlna_dmr` platform allows you to control a [DLNA Digital Media Renderer](https://www.dlna.org/), such as DLNA enabled TVs or radios.

Please note that some devices, such as Samsung TVs, are rather picky about the source used to play from. The TTS service might not work in combination with these devices. If the play_media service does not work, please try playing from a DLNA/DMS (such as [MiniDLNA](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/)).
