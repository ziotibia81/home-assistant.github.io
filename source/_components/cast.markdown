Google Cast devices like Android TVs and Chromecasts will be automatically
discovered if you enable [the discovery component](/components/discovery/). If
you don't have the discovery component enabled, you can enable the Cast
component by going to the Integrations page inside the config panel.

## {% linkable_title Advanced use %}

The Cast component has some extra configuration options available for advanced
users. You will still need to create a config entry to initialize the Cast
component.

For example, Cast devices can only be discovered if they are on the same subnet
as Home Assistant. If this is not the case,
you want to configure the IP address of the Cast device directly:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cast:
  media_player:
  - host: 192.168.1.10
```

{% configuration %}
media_player:
  description: A list that contains all Cast devices.
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    host:
      description: Use only if you don't want to scan for devices.
      required: false
      type: string
    ignore_cec:
      description: >
        A list of Chromecasts that should ignore CEC data for determining the
        active input. [See the upstream documentation for more information.](https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast#ignoring-cec-data)
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

If you want to manually configure multiple Cast media players, you can define
those as follows:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for multiple devices
cast:
  media_player:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_DEVICE_1
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_DEVICE_2
```
