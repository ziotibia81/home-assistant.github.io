The `yeelight` light platform allows you to control your Yeelight Wifi bulbs with Home Assistant.

### {% linkable_title Example configuration %}

To enable those lights, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: yeelight
    devices:
      192.168.1.25:
        name: Living Room
```

{% configuration %}

  required: true
  description: List of Yeelight devices.
  type: map
  keys:

      description: IP address of the bulb.
      required: true
      type: map
      keys:
        name:
          description: A friendly name for the device.
          required: false
          type: string
        transition:
          description: Smooth transitions over time (in ms).
          required: false
          type: integer

          default: False
        save_on_change:
          description: Saves the bulb state in its nonvolatile memory when changed from Home Assistant.
          required: false
          type: boolean
          default: False
        model:
          description: "Yeelight model. Possible values are `mono1`, `color1`, `strip1`, `bslamp1`, `ceiling1`, `ceiling2`, `ceiling3`, `ceiling4`. The setting is used to enable model specific features f.e. a particular color temperature range."
          required: false
          type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

#### {% linkable_title Music mode  %}
Per default the bulb limits the amount of requests per minute to 60, a limitation which can be bypassed by enabling the music mode. In music mode the bulb is commanded to connect back to a socket provided by the component and it tries to keep the connection open, which may not be wanted in all use-cases.
**Also note that bulbs in music mode will not update their state to "unavailable" if they are disconnected, which can cause delays in Home Assistant**.

### {% linkable_title Initial setup %}
<p class='note'>
Before trying to control your light through Home Assistant, you have to setup your bulb using Yeelight app. ( [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yeelight.cherry&hl=fr), [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yeelight/id977125608?mt=8) ).
In the bulb property, you have to enable "LAN Mode" (previously called "Developer mode"). LAN mode may only be available with the latest firmware installed on your bulb.  Firmware can be updated in the application after connecting the bulb.
Determine your bulb IP (using router, software, ping ...).
Information on how to enable "LAN Mode" can be found [here](https://getyeti.co/posts/how-to-control-yeelight-and-your-smarthome-with-yeti).
