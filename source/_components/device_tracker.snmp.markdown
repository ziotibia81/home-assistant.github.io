A lot of WiFi access points and WiFi routers support the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This is a standardized method for monitoring/manageing network connected devices. SNMP uses a tree-like hierarchy where each node is an object. Many of these objects contain (live) lists of instances and metrics, like network interfaces, disks, and WiFi registrations.

<p class='note warning'>
This device tracker needs SNMP to be enabled on the router. It could be that you need to install the SNMP support manually.

The following OID examples pull the current MAC Address table from a router. This reflects all recent devices seen on the network. However, since devices are not removed until they time out, this is less effective for [device tracker component page](/components/device_tracker/) than desirable. It is recommended to use [Ping](/components/device_tracker.ping/) or [Nmap](/components/device_tracker.nmap_tracker/) instead.

To use the SNMP version 1 platform in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for SNMP version 1
device_tracker:
  - platform: snmp
    host: 192.168.1.1
    community: public
    baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.1.2.1.1
```

If you want to use encryption, you must enable SNMP version 3 by adding `authkey` and `privkey` variables and enabling SNMP version 3 on your router. Currently only SHA1 is supported for authentication and AES for encryption. Example of SNMPv3 configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for SNMP version 3
device_tracker:
  - platform: snmp
    host: 192.168.1.1
    community: USERNAME
    authkey: AUTHPASS
    privkey: PRIVPASS
    baseoid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.14988.1.1.1.2.1.1
```
