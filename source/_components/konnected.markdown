The `konnected` component lets you connect wired sensors and switches to a NodeMCU ESP8226 based device running the [open source Konnected software](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security). Reuse the wired sensors and siren from an old or pre-wired alarm system installation and integrate them directly into Home Assistant.

Visit the [Konnected.io website](https://konnected.io) for more information about the Konnected Alarm Panel board and compatible hardware.

The component currently supports the following device types in Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor.konnected/): Wired door and window sensors, motion detectors, glass-break detectors, leak sensors, smoke & CO detectors or any open/close switch.
- [Switch](/components/switch.konnected/): Actuate a siren, strobe, buzzer or relay module.

This component requires the [`discovery`](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/discovery) component to be enabled.

### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

A `konnected` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml` file that specifies the Konnected devices on the network and the sensors or actuators attached to them:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
konnected:
  access_token: REPLACE_ME_WITH_A_RANDOM_STRING
  devices:
    - id: 438a388bcd53
      binary_sensors:

          type: door
      switches:
        - zone: out
    - id: 8bcd53438a38
      binary_sensors:

#### {% linkable_title Configuration Notes %}

- Either **pin** or **zone** is required for each actuator or sensor. Do not use both in the same definition.
- Pin `D8` or the `out` zone will only work when activation is set to high (the default).

### {% linkable_title Pin Mapping %}

Konnected runs on an ESP8266 board with the NodeMCU firmware. It is commonly used with the NodeMCU dev kit WiFi module and optionally Konnected's Alarm Panel hardware. The following table shows the pin mapping between the Konnected hardware labeled zones, the NodeMCU labeled pins and the ESP8266 GPIO pins.

| Konnected Alarm Panel Zone  | NodeMCU pin  | IO Index  | ESP8266 GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | D1  | 1  | GPIO5  |
| 2 | D2  | 2  | GPIO4  |
| 3 | D5  | 5  | GPIO14 |
| 4 | D6  | 6  | GPIO12 |
| 5 | D7  | 7  | GPIO13 |
| 6 | RX  | 9  | GPIO3  |
| ALARM or OUT | D8 | 8 | GPIO15 |

### {% linkable_title Revision History %}

#### 0.79
* Added `inverse` configuration option for binary sensors.

#### 0.77
* Added support for momentary and beep/blink switches. [[#15973](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/15973)]
* Decouple entity initialization from discovery, enabling devices to recover faster after a Home Assistant reboot. [[#16146](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/16146)]
* **Breaking change:** Device `id` in `configuration.yaml` must now be the full 12-character device MAC address. Previously, omitting the first 6 characters was allowed.

#### 0.72
* Adds `api_host` configuration option [[#14896](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/14896)]

#### 0.70
* Initial release
