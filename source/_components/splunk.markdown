The `splunk` component makes it possible to log all state changes to an external [Splunk](http://splunk.com/) database using Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) feature. You can either use this alone, or with the Home Assistant for Splunk [app](https://github.com/miniconfig/splunk-homeassistant). Since the HEC feature is new to Splunk, you will need to use at least version 6.3.

To use the `splunk` component in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
splunk:
  token: B4415DFF-683C-5C6C-3994-4F6D4A5DB03A
```

{% configuration %}
token:
  description: The HTTP Event Collector Token already created in your Splunk instance.
  required: true
  type: string
host:
  description: "IP address or host name of your Splunk host e.g., 192.168.1.10."
  required: false
  default: localhost
  type: string
port:
  description: Port to use.
  required: false
  default: 8080
  type: integer
ssl:
  description: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to connect.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
name:
  description: This parameter allows you to specify a friendly name to send to Splunk as the host, instead of using the name of the HEC.
  required: false
  default: HASS
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
