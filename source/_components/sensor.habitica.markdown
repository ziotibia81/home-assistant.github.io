The `habitica` sensor platform allows you to view and monitor your player data from [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) in Home Assistant.

<p class='note'>
You must have the [`habitica` component](/components/habitica/)
configured to use this platform. After configuring that component, sensors specified there will automatically appear.
