The `mychevy` binary sensor platform allows you to monitor your Chevy Bolt car from within Home Assistant.

The binary sensor platform will be automatically configured if the `mychevy` component is configured.

For configuration instructions, see the [`mychevy` component](/components/mychevy/) documentation.
