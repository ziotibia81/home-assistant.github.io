To get your [wirelesstag.net](http://wirelesstag.net) switches working within Home Assistant, please follow the instructions for the general [WirelessTag component](/components/wirelesstag).

To enable tags set up with your [wirelesstag.net](http://wirelesstag.net) account, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: wirelesstag
    monitored_conditions:
      - motion
      - humidity
```

{% configuration %}
  monitored_conditions:
    description: The metrics types to control; valid values are specified below
    required: true
    type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

The following metrics can be controlled:

* (`temperature`): Control arm/disarm temperature monitoring.
* (`humidity`): Control arm/disarm humidity monitoring.
* (`motion`): Control arm/disarm motion and door open/close events monitoring.
* (`light`): Control monitoring of light changes.
* (`moisture`): Control monitoring of water level/soil moisture for water sensor.

Arm/Disarm of motion switch is required to receive motion and door binary sensors events.
Others are only needed if you want to receive push notifications from tags on a specific range of changes in temperature, humidity, light or moisture.
