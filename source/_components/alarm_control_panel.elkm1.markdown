The `elkm1` platform allows you to control your [Elk-M1](https://www.elkproducts.com/m1_controls.html).

An Elk-M1 area (also known as partition) is represented as an `alarm_control_panel`.

<p class='note'>
Full configuration details can be found on the main [Elk-M1 component](/components/elkm1/) page.
