<p class='note'>
  Use [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) to integrate with Google Assistant without any effort.
</p>

The `google_assistant` component allows you to control things via Google Assistant (on your mobile or tablet) or a Google Home device.

The Google Assistant component requires a bit more setup than most due to the way Google requires Assistant Apps to be set up.

<p class='note'>
To use Google Assistant, your Home Assistant configuration has to be externally accessible with a hostname and SSL certificate. If you haven't already configured that, you should do so before continuing.
</p>

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

You need to create an API Key with the [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview) which allows you to update devices without unlinking and relinking an account (see [below](/#troubleshooting-the-request_sync-service)). If you don't provided it the `google_assistant.request_sync` service is not exposed. It is recommended to set up this configuration key as it also allows the usage of the following command, "Ok Google, sync my devices". Once you have setup this component you will need to call this service (or command) each time you add a new device that you wish to control via the Google Assistant integration.

1. Create a new project in the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com/).
  a. Add/Import project, give it a name
  b. Click on `Home Control` card, select the `Smart home` recommendation.
  c. Create an Action, under the build section. Add in your Home Assistant URL: `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL:PORT]/api/google_assistant`, replace the `[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL:PORT]` with the domain / ip address and the port under which your Home Assistant is reachable.
  d. Click `Done`. Then click on `Overview`, which will lead you back to the app details screen.
2. `Account linking` is required for your app to interact with Home Assistant. Set this up under the `Quick Setup` section
	a. Leave it at the default `No, I only want to allow account creation on my website` and select Next
	b. For the `Linking type` select `OAuth` and `Authorization Code`
	c. Client ID: `https://oauth-redirect.googleusercontent.com/`, the trailing slash is important
	d. Client Secret: Anything you like, Home Assistant don't need this field
	e. Authorization URL (replace with your actual URL): `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL:PORT]/auth/authorize`.
	f. Token URL (replace with your actual URL): `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL:PORT]/auth/token`.
	g. Configure your client. Add scopes for `email` and `name`.
	h. Do NOT check `Google to transmit clientID and secret via HTTP basic auth header`
	i. Testing instructions: Enter anything. It doesn't matter since you won't submit this app.
3. Back on the overview page. Click `Simulator` under `TEST`. It will create a new draft version Test App. You don't have to actually test.
4. If you haven't already added the component configuration to `configuration.yaml` file and restarted Home Assistant, you'll be unable to continue until you have.
5. Open the Google Assistant app and go into `Settings > Home Control`
6. Click the `+` sign, and near the bottom, you should have `[test] your app name`. Selecting that should lead you to a browser to login your Home Assistant instance, then redirect back to a screen where you can set rooms for your devices or nicknames for your devices.
7. If you want to allow other household users to control the devices:
	a. Go to the settings for the project you created in point 1 in the developer console.
	b. Under the gear icon, click `Permissions`
	c. Click `Add`, type the new user's e-mail address and choose `Project -> Editor` role
	d. Have the new user go to [developer console](https://console.actions.google.com/) and repeat steps starting from point 3
8. If you want to use the `google_assistant.request_sync` service, to update devices without unlinking and relinking, in Home Assistant, then enable Homegraph API for your project:
	a. Go to the [cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview)
	b. Select your project and click Enable Homegraph API
	c. Go to Credentials, which you can find on the left navigation bar under the key icon, and select API Key from Create Credentials
	d. Note down the generated API Key and use this in the configuration

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To enable this, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
google_assistant:
  project_id: someproject-2d0b8
  api_key: [a Homegraph API Key generated for the Google Actions project]
  exposed_domains:
    - switch
    - light
    - group
  entity_config:
    switch.kitchen:
      name: Custom Name for Google Assistant
      aliases:
        - bright lights
        - entry lights
    light.living_room:
      expose: false
      room: living room
```

Configuration variables:

{% configuration %}

project_id:
  description: Project ID from the Google Developer console (looks like `words-2ab12`)
  required: true
  type: string
api_key:
  description: Your API key.
  required: false
  type: string
expose_by_default:
  description: "Expose devices in all supported domains by default. If set to false, you need to either expose domains or add the expose configuration option to each entity in `entity_config` and set it to true."

  default: True
  type: boolean

          description: Allows for associating this device to a Room in Google Assistant.
          required: false
          type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Available domains %}

Currently, the following domains are available to be used with Google Assistant, listed with their default types:

- group (on/off)
- input boolean (on/off)
- scene (on)
- script (on)
- switch (on/off)
- fan (on/off)
- light (on/off/brightness/rgb color/color temp)
- cover (on/off/set position (via set brightness))
- media_player (on/off/set volume (via set brightness))
- climate (temperature setting)

It's very important that you use very long strings for `client_id` and `access_token`. Those are essentially the credentials to your Home Assistant instance. You can generate them with the following command:

```bash
$ cat /dev/urandom | fold -w 120 | head -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | tr -dc '0-9A-Za-z' | cut -c -80
```

If you're not using Linux, you can use sites such as [this one](https://www.browserling.com/tools/random-string) to generate a random string (containing mixed case letters and numbers) of up to 80 characters.

### {% linkable_title Troubleshooting the request_sync service %}

The request_sync service requires that the initial sync from Google includes the agent_user_id. If not, the service will log an error that reads something like "Request contains an invalid argument". If this happens, then [unlink the account](https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7506443?hl=en-GB) from Home Control and relink.

The request_sync service may fail with a 404 if the project_id of the Homegraph API differs from the project_id of the Actions SDK found in the preferences of your project on [developer console](https://console.actions.google.com). Resolve this by:

  1. Removing your project from the [developer console](https://console.actions.google.com).
  2. Add a new project to the [cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com). Here you get a new `project_id`.
  3. Enable Homegraph API to the new project.
  4. Generate a new API key.
  5. Again, create a new project in the [developer console](https://console.actions.google.com/). Described above. But at the step 'Build under the Actions SDK box' choose your newly created project. By this, they share the same `project_id`.

### {% linkable_title Troubleshooting with NGINX %}

When using NGINX, ensure that your `proxy_pass` line *does not* have a trailing `/`, as this will result in errors. Your line should look like:

    proxy_pass http://localhost:8123;
