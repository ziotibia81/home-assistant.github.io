The `evohome` platform is the main component to set up and integrate all supported evohome devices.

It uses the [evohomeclient](https://pypi.org/project/evohomeclient/) client library and so will let you control (only) _EU-based_ [Honeywell Connect Comfort](https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/Account/Login) systems.

Currently, only Controllers are supported; support for Heating zones and DHW controllers will be added at a later time.

It is related to the [honeywell](/components/climate.honeywell/) climate component, which allows limited integration with evohome Heating zones.  These two components should be usuable side-by-side, but YMMV.


## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To use this component in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
evohome:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  location_idx: 0
```
This is a IoT cloud-polling device, and the `scan_interval` is currently fixed at 3 minutes.  Testing has indicated that this is a safe interval that - by itself - shouldn't cause you to be rate-limited by Honeywell.
