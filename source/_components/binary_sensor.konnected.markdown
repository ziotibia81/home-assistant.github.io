The `konnected` binary sensor allows you to monitor wired door sensors, window sensors, motion sensors, smoke detectors, CO detectors, glass-break sensors, water leak sensors or any other simple wired open/close circuit attached to a NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi module running the [open source Konnected software](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security).

See the [`konnected`](/components/konnected/) component for configuration and setup instructions.

This component supports all of the built-in device classes of the generic [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor/) component.
