The `mycroft` notification platform allows you to deliver notifications from Home Assistant to [Mycroft AI](https://mycroft.ai/).

Please check the [`mycroft` component](/components/mycroft/) for details.

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).
