[eQ-3 MAX!](http://www.eq-3.com/products/max.html) integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect eQ-3 MAX! components via the eQ-3 MAX! Cube. The components connects to the eQ-3 MAX! Cube via TCP and automatically makes all supported components available in Home Assistant. The name for each device is created by concatenating the MAX! room and device names.

Limitations:
- Configuring weekly schedules is not possible.
- Implementation is based on the reverse engineered [MAX! protocol](https://github.com/Bouni/max-cube-protocol).

Supported Devices:
- MAX! Radiator Thermostat (tested)
- MAX! Radiator Thermostat+
- MAX! Window Sensor (tested)
- MAX! Wall Thermostat (tested)
