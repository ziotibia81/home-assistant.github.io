The `watson_iot` component enables you to link the devices in Home Assistant
with an [IBM Watson IoT Platform instance](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/internet-of-things-cloud).

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To use this component, you first need to register a gateway device type and then
a gateway device in your IoT platform instance. For instructions on how to do
this check the [official documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/gateways/dashboard.html#IoT_connectGateway)
which provides the details on doing this. After you register the gateway device
for your home-assistant you'll need 4 pieces of information:
 - Organization ID
 - Gateway device Type
 - Gateway device ID
 - Authentication Token

With this basic information you can configure the component:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry:
watson_iot:
  organization: 'organization_id'
  type: 'device_type'
  id: 'device_id'
  token: 'auth_token'
```

{% configuration %}
organization:
  description: The Organization ID for your Watson IoT Platform instance
  required: true
  type: string
type:
  description: The device type for the gateway device to use
  required: true
  type: string
id:
  description: The device id for the gateway device to use
  required: true
  type: string
token:
  description: The authentication token for the gateway device
  required: true
  type: string
exclude:
  description: Configure which components should be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
include:
  description: Configure which components should be included in recordings to Watson IoT Platform. If set, all other entities will not be recorded to Watson IoT Platform. Values set by the **blacklist** option will prevail.
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be included from recordings to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be included from recordings to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}
