The `webostv` platform allows you to send notifications to a LG webOS Smart TV.

When the TV is first connected,
you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`
file and follow the configurator instructions:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - platform: webostv
    host: 192.168.0.112
    name: livingroom_tv
    filename: webostv.conf
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP of the LG webOS Smart TV, e.g., 192.168.0.10
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name you would like to give to the LG webOS Smart TV.
  required: true
  type: string
filename:
  description: "The filename where the pairing key with the TV should be stored. This path is relative to Home Assistant's config directory. **NOTE**: When using multiple TVs each TV will need its own unique file."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: webostv.conf
icon:
  description: The path to an image file to use as the icon in notifications.
  required: false
  type: [string, icon]
{% endconfiguration %}

A possible automation could be:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  - alias: Open a window
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.netatmo_livingroom_co2
      above: 999
    action:
      service: notify.livingroom_tv
      data:
        message: "You should open a window! (Livingroom Co2: {{ states.sensor.netatmo_livingroom_co2.state }}ppm)"
```

The icon can be overridden for individual notifications by providing a path to
an alternative icon image to use:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Front door motion
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_motion
      to: 'on'
    action:
      service: notify.livingroom_tv
      data:
        message: "Movement detected: Front Door"
        data:
          icon: "/home/homeassistant/images/doorbell.png"
```
