Mailboxes provide a list of messages with short information about each. Mailbox messages appear on a separate panel in the frontend.

Home Assistant currently supports only the [Asterisk Voicemail](/component/mailbox.asterisk_mbox) mailbox.

Each mailbox also provides an entity to indicate the number of messages available on the main page.
