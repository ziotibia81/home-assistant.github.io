The `transport_nsw` sensor will give you the time until the next departure from a Transport NSW stop (bus, train or ferry).

Get your free API key from [Transport NSW](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/).

In order to find the stop id, just go to Google maps and click on the bus/train/ferry stop. It will give you there the stop ID.

You can define a bus line, but if you donâ€™t do it, the sensor will pick up the next stop event from any line servicing this stop.

Then add the data to your `configuration.yaml` file as shown in the example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: transport_nsw
    stop_id: '200024'
    api_key: 'YOUR API KEY'
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
