To run Home Assistant on Microsoft Windows installation you need to install Python first. Download Python (the latest version of Python 3.6 is recommended) for [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and follow the instructions of the installer.

<p class='note'>
There may be alpha or beta releases of Python listed on that download page (marked by the letters `a` or `b` in the version number. Do not use these versions.
</p>

If you use your machine for something other than Home Assistant, you should install it in a [Python virtual environment](#Installing_in_a_Python_virtual_environment).

Start 

```bash
C:\...\> pip3 install homeassistant
C:\...\> py -m homeassistant --open-ui
```

For autostarting Home Assistant please refer to this [guide](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/autostart-on-windows/3504).

Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X27eVvuqwnY) for the installation on Windows 10.

<p class='note warning'>
The Microsoft Windows platform is not a primary target to install Home Assistant. Also, not all tools and third-party modules will work.
