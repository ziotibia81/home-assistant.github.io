Glance cards are very compact. Very useful to group together multiple sensors for a quick and easy overview. Keep in mind that this can be used together with [entity-filter](/lovelace/entity-filter/) cards to create dynamic cards.

If you define entities as objects instead of strings, you can add more customization and configuration:

{% configuration %}
entity:
  required: true
  description: Home Assistant entity ID.

  type: string
service_data:
  required: false
  description: The service data to use.
  type: object
  default: "entity_id: entity_id"
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

Basic example:

```yaml
- type: glance
  title: Glance card sample
  entities:
    - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
    - light.bed_light
    - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
    - sensor.outside_temperature
    - light.ceiling_lights
    - switch.ac
    - lock.kitchen_door
```

Define entities as objects and apply a custom name:

```yaml
- type: glance
  title: Better names
  entities:
    - entity: binary_sensor.movement_backyard
      name: Movement?
    - light.bed_light
    - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
    - sensor.outside_temperature
    - light.ceiling_lights
    - switch.ac
    - lock.kitchen_door
```
