Start this add-on to activate the BCM43xx Bluetooth chipset in the old ResinOS based builds. If you first installed Hass.io after mid July 2018 then you will have a HassOS based system.

You can identify the base of your system by looking in the System tab of the Hass.io menu.

<p class='note warning'>
 This is not required on the new HassOS based Hass.io installs and should not be installed.

Supported platforms:

- Raspberry Pi 3
